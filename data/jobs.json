The <a href=\"http://gitcoin.co/results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">results of the product</a> speak for itself. It was built in a centralized way which greatly accelerated the ability to iterate, make decisions and focus on impact through experimentation. Today, the centralized platform hosts Grants Rounds quarterly, primarily for the Ethereum community, and nearly a dozen related/reliant ecosystems. With this success as a proofpoint, we are on a mission to build and scale a distributed platform for novel funding mechanisms for the optimal distribution of capital to projects and ecosystems that build public goods.</p>\n\n<p>We have developed a prototype of a protocol that will bring Grants into it’s decentralized future. In 2022 the Grants team will be focused on designing and developing the next generation of Grants user interfaces that will serve to not only continue running our fully hosted grants program, but will enable any ecosystem to self-service the running of their own grants program.

With this success as a proofpoint, we are on a mission to build and scale a distributed platform for novel funding mechanisms for the optimal distribution of capital to projects and ecosystems that build public goods.</p>\n\n<p>The dGrants protocol is central to Gitcoin’s future and growth and the team is chartered with paving the way to a future where running a grants program is as easy as building a blog on Wordpress.  In 2021 the dGrants team successfully built a prototype of the protocol and tested it by running an alpha round followed by a beta test round during Grants Round 13. 2022 is our year for launching a production ready protocol.</p>\n<h3>About the Role:</h3>\n<p>We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to join the dGrants team.

We believe Ethereum and decentralized protocol technology is a more trustworthy and equitable foundation for how we create and share value across the web. On this trusted, open source foundation, we can accelerate the world’s transition to a universally accessible network of distributed participants where transparency, security and freedom are fundamental.</p>\n\n<p>Our product suite, composed of Truffle, Infura, Quorum, Codefi, MetaMask, and Diligence, serves millions of users, supports billions of blockchain-based queries for our clients, and has handled billions of dollars in digital assets. As the leading Ethereum software company, ConsenSys enables developers, enterprises, and people worldwide to build next-generation applications, launch modern financial infrastructure, and access the decentralized web. To learn more about ConsenSys, and explore our products and solutions, visit <a href=\"http://consensys.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://consensys.net/</a>. </p>\n<h3><strong>Why join ConsenSys?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Remote first.</strong> You’ll be joining a team based all over the world. Providing the unique opportunity to work with people from many different countries and cultures. Want to work remotely? Go ahead. Or pop into one of our offices? We’ve got you covered in NYC, DC, Dublin, London, Paris, Brisbane and Hong Kong. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Flexible working arrangements.</strong> You can create your own journey with flexible schedules and locations. We believe everyone has the right to control their own freedom. Our people can make their own schedule, own their own time, and we encourage you to travel and work from anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Continuous learning and opportunities.</strong> You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas and frameworks from your peers and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. To support your development we pay for you to learn by offering unlimited access to Coursera, a platform with thousands of courses for you to learn whatever you want, and acquire new skills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unlimited vacation/holidays.</strong> We value downtime to recharge and reset ensuring everyone at ConsenSys has work/life balance. Company-wide we participate in “zero productivity” days every quarter to take a break from work, shut down, and sit back and relax. </p>\n\n<p><strong>One of the most recognized tech companies in the blockchain ecosystem globally.</strong> Work experience at ConsenSys is a tremendous reference for your future career. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem.   </p>\n<h3><strong>About Infura</strong></h3>\n<p>Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.</p>\n\n<p>We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.</p>\n\n<p>Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together. </p>\n<h3><strong>What you’ll do</strong></h3>\n<p>Infura delivers blockchain API access at internet scale. Look forward to applying the techniques and scaling tricks you’ve learned over your career to the emerging blockchain technology set. Using GoLang, you will build out system APIs, daemons, and other such microservices to support our high volume APIs and our customer facing frontends. You will analyze and optimize performance in high-traffic internet applications to deliver the best experience to the engineers we serve.</p>\n\n<p>Architect and design systems that provide reliable, scalable access to various blockchains and decentralized networks. Collaborate with an experienced team of senior engineers to build an infrastructure that can service a growing number of developers and projects that are building for the blockchain. The systems you build will be powering the innovation happening in the web3 world.</p>\n<h3><strong>Would be great if you brought this to the role</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ideally you have 5+ years of experience focussed on backend engineering, systems engineering, or scaling web services. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>GoLang is the primary language at Infura and experience with it is preferred, but deep experience with any strongly typed languages supporting concurrency would be sufficient.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Infura works with open source stacks, so direct experience with open source technologies such as Linux, Docker, Redis, RDBMS and NoSQL storage systems. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Experience with distributed systems is a bonus.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A natural curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and interest in diving into blockchain and its complex code bases will help you succeed in this role.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our most successful engineers have a constant desire to improve, refine, and take things higher.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Great communication and proven abilities to work in a team setting (on premises or fully remote).</p>\n\n<p>Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our remote-friendly, energetic start-up environment—apply anyway. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

                "description": "<h3>Position Overview</h3>\n<p>Conceived on the back of the 2017 crypto wave, Pocket Network was borne of a realization. While Infura enabled the ICO boom, it also made it extremely vulnerable due to operating as a single point of failure. A secure, efficient, and censorship-resistant future for Web3 must be enabled by truly decentralized infrastructure, not by centralized platforms gating access to networks.</p>\n\n<p>The pitfalls of Web2 become more obvious by the day - security breaches, gatekeepers, and ever-more aggressive censorship have turned the open-source dream of the free internet into increasingly dystopian surveillance and control system. Pocket Network offers a radical escape: a means to bring the free internet back, only this time it's unstoppable.</p>\n\n<p>Our engineering department currently includes a small stable team – specialists in critical areas, our CTO, and our CEO. We’ve achieved a great deal, but we also understand that “what got you here, won’t get you there”. We will be scaling up the engineering team in 2022 and we want to bring smart people aboard that will help make fulfill the goals and deliver the best platform while ensuring quality.</p>\n\n<p>That’s where you come in: you will be in charge of everyday research, design, and development of new technologies for the Pocket Blockchain Protocol. You will have to drive your progress and propose new ideas and solutions that will make our Protocol faster, leaner, robust, and secure.</p>\n\n<p>You should also be an active member of the Pocket community, you will have to be a leader and role model for community developers that will join the project. You will have the opportunity to do research and present papers that will drive and motivate others to participate in the development of the Blockchain Protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Success will be measured primarily in qualitative terms, which may include but are not limited to: participating in ideation meetings, bringing new ideas to the table and running research to find the best solutions, and implementing those ideas with quality in mind.</p>\n<h3>Key Projects &amp; Objectives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>R&amp;D\n\n<ul>\n<li>On a daily basis, you will be running research, designing systems, and participating in ideation meetings to bring new solutions to the table</li>\n<li>Participate in other member's Ideas, by discussing and proposing improvements</li>\n<li>Help another team member to run research and comparison about different options</li>\n<li>Write reports and papers about research results</li>\n<li>Accept suggestions, ideas and help with your research tasks</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Implementation\n\n<ul>\n<li>Protocol level features on GoLang</li>\n<li>Automated test platforms</li>\n<li>Debug, setup, and test tooling to help developers and users</li>\n<li>Code refactoring for improving performance, security, and readability</li>\n<li>Apply best practices and standard styling</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Review\n\n<ul>\n<li>Code review implementations, comment and suggest improvements</li>\n<li>Help other team members to unblock their work</li>\n<li>Participate in projects by providing your best knowledge</li>\n<li>Review community contributions and help the community participation in the project</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Role model\n\n<ul>\n<li>Participate in community channels, answer questions,s and review projects</li>\n<li>Follow the contribution guide patterns to be an example for the community</li>\n<li>Identify improvements and bugs on community forums and GitHub comments</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who We’re Looking For and Why You Should Care</h3>\n<p>As a mission-driven organization, Pocket Network is a rewarding and engaging place to work for those who embrace our core ethos, which could be distilled as a commitment to results, truth, openness, kindness, stewardship, gratitude, and collaboration. Huge egos need not apply. At Pocket, the best idea wins.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll come from a production environment in software engineering. You’ll probably (but not necessarily) have a DevOps background. What’s most important is that you’re a relentless optimizer and tinkerer, a great systems thinker who can see how pieces of a process fit together, then deconstruct, rebuild and optimize them in order to produce improved outcomes (and test, test, test). You’ll be a skilled practical problem solver who enjoys finding weak links and experimenting with ways to improve them.</p>\n\n<p>You have a deep understanding of Computer Science, Networking, P2P, and preferably GoLang. You’ve been working on related areas like Backend, Infrastructure, and Low-Level library development for the last years. You love to research and design complete systems from scratch, understanding every line of code and maximizing every library and pattern.</p>\n\n<p>As such, while it’s important you have a grounding in a real-world software engineering environment, it’s mindset and attitude we’re looking for more so than any specific tech stack, job title, or level of experience. If you love engineering but wish you could spend less time on the minutiae and more time on building and optimizing a well-oiled software production machine, this might just be exactly the job for you.</p>\n\n<p>Pocket is an idea whose time has come. While the fundamental engineering, product, and revenue infrastructure are in place and product-market fit has been proven, the vast majority of potential and impact lies in the future. For ambitious builders and innovators, there couldn't be a better time to join us. And you’ll get to help us solve one of the most urgent and pressing problems of our time – a generational crisis - by helping us to build secure, censorship-resistant Web3 infrastructure and restore the free and open internet.</p>\n",
