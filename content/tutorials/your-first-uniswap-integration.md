Here’s what we’ll accomplish:

- Set up a basic, reusable development environment to build and test smart contracts that interact with the Uniswap Protocol
- Run a local development Ethereum node forked from Mainnet that includes the full Uniswap Protocol
- Write a basic smart contract that executes a swap on Uniswap V3
- Deploy and test that contract
