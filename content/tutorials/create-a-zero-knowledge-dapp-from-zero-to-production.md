This is a step-by-step guide on how to build a Zero Knowledge (zk) Decentralized Application (DApp) from zero to production.

The goal is to explain the flow of a zk dapp and deploy it so that users can use it.

- We will create a zk DApp to prove that someone knows how to solve a sudoku game, without revealing the answer.
- We will use Circom (for circuits), Solidity (for smart contracts) and Javascript (for the frontend).
- I will cover circuits and smart contracts testing.
- I will give some tips that I use to build and organize this kind of projects.
