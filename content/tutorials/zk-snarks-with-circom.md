circom is a compiler written in Rust for compiling circuits written in the circom language. The compiler outputs the representation of the circuit as constraints and everything needed to compute and verify different ZK proofs. You can choose to directly export the verifier to Solidity, allowing you to build powerful and scalable DApps by leveraging the magic of zero knowledge proofs.
