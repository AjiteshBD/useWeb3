Solidity Starters : A Beginners Friendly book 
Learn Smart contract development with solidity language, Fundamentals of solidity, Beginners guide to solidity & Ethereum blockchain programming 2022
Dive into the exciting world of blockchain development with Solidity, the programming language used by Ethereum.

Blockchain developers are in high demand these days, and the demand is only going to grow. But what skills do you need to become a blockchain developer? How can you start learning about the technology?

Learn to create and deploy your first smart contract and decentralized app.

In this course, you will learn everything you need to know to create and deploy your first decentralized app with a smart contract. You will get an introduction to Solidity and how smart contracts work, as well as how the Ethereum blockchain stores information. We'll go through tools you can use to deploy your Dapp and write code in Solidity. By the end of the course, you should have an understanding

Create Web 3 dApps with solidity and use Data Structures to store data in a decentralized ledger.

This is a book for those interested in creating decentralized applications with Solidity, the programming language for smart contracts. You will learn how to create Dapps that store data in decentralized ledger.

This practical guide teaches budding Ethereum developers how to create smart contracts and DApps using Solidity.

This guide will help developers take their first steps in the decentralized world of Ethereum development, teaching them how to create smart contracts and DApps using Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum.

Covers the latest version of Solidity,Build decentralised applications that cannot be censored or shut down.

With the rise of the internet, we have seen an increase in the use of centralised applications. This has led to many security and censorship problems. Decentralised applications are a solution to these issues. Decentralised applications are typically open-source, have transparent data sharing and management systems, have a consensus mechanism for content submission, allow for privacy and anonymity of users, and do not rely


After finishing this Book, You will have a solid foundation in Solidity and a high degree of experience, allowing you to start creating and quickly expanding your knowledge.
