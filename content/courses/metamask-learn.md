You may have heard a lot of jargon related to Web3: distributed ledgers, crypto, NFTs. But what’s revolutionary about the technology is more than the sum of the technical parts; it’s the power it gives you. 

Our lives are increasingly digital and interconnected. Our screens are our windows, our data defines our identity, and more and more of our time is spent online.

Historically, trust in society comes from subjective sources — from personal connections, platforms, institutions. At its core, Web3 is a new foundation for trust, where everything can be verified and you don’t need to place your trust in a single source or entity. 

This new common trust changes what the web is, and what you can do with it. It’s a web for you to own, for us to own. Where the printing press democratized the dissemination of information, Web3 democratizes the creation and dissemination of value. 

Through a series of interactive lessons, MetaMask Learn will show you what Web3 is, why it’s important to you, and how to use MetaMask along the way.

We want to share our enthusiasm for the Web3 of today, and empower you to build, explore, and participate in the world of tomorrow.
