Ethereum has reached one of its long awaited milestones — The Merge!

It was truly momentous. After 7 long long years, the Ethereum community managed to replace proof of work with a proof of stake consensus protocol. The immediate impact is reducing the network’s energy consumption by a whopping 99.95% and 0.02% of global electricity usage.

Hooray!

There are also many other technical benefits to celebrate the upgrade, but the benefits are lost to most of the community. It is time — especially now that proof of stake is protecting hundreds of billions of dollars — to write more accessible material on how it works, why it is important, and what exciting features await us.
