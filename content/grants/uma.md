UMA Protocol is keen to make our optimistic oracle and associated contracts as easy as possible for developers to use.  
  
To this end Risk Labs are offering grants to a maximum value of $10k paid in $UMA to provide tooling, support and educational products and services to better support those who wish to build on the UMA protocol. The total grant pool is estimated at $100k equivalent.  
  
Applications for grants opens on 1st October 2022, and will remain open until 31st December 2022 or until grant funds are exhausted. Grants will be awarded on a rolling basis at the discretion of the Risk Labs team.
