This repository contains a boilerplate for full stack development of a Zero Knowledge decentralized application with the use of DSLs and tools such as Hardhat, Circom, Snarkjs, Nextjs etc.


If you ever get stuck, and need a guide to reference, the guide written by Vivian Plasencia, "How to create a Zero Knowledge Dapp, from Zero to Production", is a great one, and where the inspiration for this boilerplate, was derived from.
